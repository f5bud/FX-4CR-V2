F5BUD V2 Firmware FAQ
=====================
- A: What is "Version 2" of the Firmware developed by OM Daniel, F5BUD
- Q: V2 of the FW is an alternative firmware for the FX-4CR transceiver (designed and built by BG2FX) developed by F5BUD in his spare time. It is offered on an "as is" basis without any warranties whatsoever. If you don't like it - please revert to the factory Version 1.x (currently 1.7) supplied by BG2FX

- Q: What are the main differences between V2.x and V1.7 factory FW
- A: F5BUD's FW is built around a real-time operating system (RTOS) which makes it much more responsive. The list of additional features is too long for this FAQ. Check out the user manual include in zip for an overview of the additional features.

- Q: Will F5BUD's "2.x" Firmware run on all versions of the FX-4CR?
- A: I will run on the first generation "V" models and 3rd generation "R" models.
It is important to adhere to the installation procedure described in the manual.<br>
Unfortunately there is no version of V2 FW for the FX-4CR "VR" model.

- Q: So what do I do with my "VR" model stuck with BF2FX factory firmware?
- A: There will be many hams interested in purchasing this transceiver even with BG2FX FW who don't need the additional features and are reluctant to flash third party firmware to their radio. The FX4-C V1.7 VR version can hold its own against other small SDR transceivers.

- Q: If I believe to have discovered a bug or have an idea or suggestion to improve the software, what is the best way of making myself heard by the developer?
- A: you have 3 options:<br>
  + a) posting a message in the groups.io message board. If it's a new issue opening a new subject with a clear header is a good idea, e.g. "FW2.x - bug report" or - "feature request"<br>
  + b) writing an e-mail to Daniel<br>
  + c) opening a "issues" on Github, the firmware's development platform<br><br>
Of the 3 options c) is the best and b) the worst.<br>
Opening an account on Github ("git" in short) - if you don't have one already - is a matter of a minute or two and scanning the other "issues" will show you if someone else has already had the same - or even a better idea. This is the main ideal of Github: a controlled development environment and "version control" of the software development process

- Q: Who is responsible for support and hand-holding?
- A: YOU are the main actor yourself. Before asking others, in this order:<br>
  + a) PLEASE READ THE MANUAL. This is continously being updated with new SW features and a lot of work has gone into this.<br>
  + b) scan the messagess on groups.io or the BG2FX FB account using the search function.<br>
  + c) enter your issue into your favorite AI platform. This can get you surprisingly accurate results in fractions of a second.<br>
Please only mail the developers as a last resort!

- Q: Is the any way I can show my appreciation for this great piece of software making my FX-4CR experience so much better?
- A: Why not donate to a children's charity, for example?

FX-4CR general FAQ
==================
- Q What is the correct size of the DC power supply barrel plug?
- A: The correct size is 5.5mm or 5.4mm (OD) x 2.5mm (hole); same as the IC-705.
The widespread 5.5mm x 2.1mm plug e.g. for QMX and most other 12V powered rigs will not fit due to its too small hole. 

- Q: Are all batches of "V", "VR" and "R" hardware of the FX-4CR transceiver identical?
- A: No they are not; it is likely there are differences between various batches of the three main versions for various reasons. For example, the known susceptibility of the rig to RF entering the cabinet through unbypassed accessory leads was finally corrected with R versions shipped after around 6/2025.
